\section{Professional Background}
\cventry{2020--\the\year}{Senior Software Engineer}{Tatango}{Remote}{}{
At Tatango, I leveraged a robust tech stack that included Ruby on Rails, TypeScript, React, and Node.js to design and implement features across both front-end and back-end systems. As a Tech Lead, I played a key role in cloud architecture, utilizing AWS services such as S3, CloudFront, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and CDK to deliver scalable features and infrastructure. Among many accomplishments, I can highlight:
\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemindent{2em}
    \item Implemented a Lambda-based processing pipeline capable of handling millions of messages in a short timespan, significantly improving system throughput and efficiency.
    \item Implemented a custom URL shortening system able to handle sudden bursts of millions of redirections
    \item Streamlined the development process by introducing feature flags into the codebase, resulting in smaller pull requests and drastically improving the development cycle time.
    \item Spearheaded improvements to the deployment pipeline, enabling the team to shift from bi-weekly deployments to multiple daily releases, greatly enhancing deployment speed and reducing time-to-market.
    \item Created an internal CLI tool to automate everyday tasks, increasing efficiency for the development team.
\end{itemize}
