\section{Professional Background}
\cventry{2020--\the\year}{Senior Software Engineer}{Tatango}{Remote}{}{
At Tatango, I leveraged a robust tech stack that included Ruby on Rails, TypeScript, React, and Node.js to design and implement features across front-end and back-end systems. As a Tech Lead, I was responsible for cloud architecture, utilizing AWS services such as CloudFront, API Gateway, Lambda, SQS and DynamoDB to deliver scalable features and infrastructure. Key accomplishments include:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=2em]
    \item Implemented a Lambda-based processing pipeline to handle millions of messages in a short timespan, significantly boosting system throughput.
    \item Implemented a custom URL shortening system capable of processing sudden bursts of millions of redirections to accomodate traffic generated by mass SMS/MMS campaigns.
    \item Streamlined the development process by introducing feature flags, resulting in smaller pull requests and faster development cycles.
    \item Led improvements to the deployment pipeline, transitioning from bi-weekly deployments to multiple daily releases, enhancing deployment speed and reducing time-to-market.
    \item Built an internal CLI tool to automate everyday tasks, increasing development team efficiency.
\end{itemize}
